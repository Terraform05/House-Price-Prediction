# House Prices Prediction

## Overview and Goal 
This project focuses on predicting house sales prices based on a comprehensive dataset that includes 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts house prices.

## Skills Practiced
- Feature selection
- Regression models:
  - to be explored
- Parameter tuning to avoid overfitting

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to house characteristics:
- Characteristics to be explored

The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock and serves as an educational tool for data scientists looking for a modernized alternative to the Boston Housing dataset.

## Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated based on RMSE between the logarithms of predicted and actual sales prices, giving equal weight to errors in predicting both expensive and cheaper houses.
